### About Me
I'm REM. I am 14 years old, and I have been programming for around 6 years.
I specialize in Java, but have more recently become semi-proficient in C#. 
I still have a lot to learn, but considering that I am still in school, I feel lucky to be as proficient as I am.
I also love to play guitar, both acoustic and electric. I have played acoustic guitar for nearly 9 years and electric for around 7. 
I am on a FIRST Tech Challenge (link) team called Atomic Robotics. To learn more about FTC and how you can participate, click here (link _blank).

### Welcome
Hello and welcome to my website! To read more about me, click here (link).
This website is a multi-purpose website where I will document my programming projects, successes, and failures, and share insights about what turned out to be a time sink and what was effective. I will also post the occasional tutorial or finished project that is available for download on my github (link _blank).
